# School District Analysis

## Overview
I was given the task to parse through data to get math, reading, and overall scores for students while looking at different factors such as Grade, school spending, school size, and school type. After that analysis was done it was found that the 9th grade Thomas High School scores were manipulated so they needed to be disqualified from the data and a new analysis had to be done.

## Results

- How the district summary was affected after changes
    - When comparing the district summaries all of the scores either decreased except for *Average Reading Score* which stayed the same. So the districts scores got worse after taking out the manipulated grades.
